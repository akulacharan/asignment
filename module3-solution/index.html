			Gutti vankaya
		</div>
		<p>
			Guti vankaya kura is a stuffed brinjal dish from the Andhra cuisine. Here the stuffing is made from a mix of desiccated coconut, peanuts and spices, which is ground finely. Small tender brinjals are stuffed with this ground masala and then cooked. A bit of tamarind pulp is added to the gravy for a faint sour taste.
			The preparation of masala and stuffing the brinjals, takes some times. Once you are done with the preparation & stuffing, then the remaining process is easy. I have made the tamarind pulp separately. But you can just add the tamarind to the coconut+spices while grinding. To balance the sourness, you can also add some jaggery in the gravy.

			Sambar
		</div>
		<p>
			Sambar, a hot and spicy lentil soup with mixed vegetables, is a must have accompaniment for popular South Indian breakfast and lunch recipes like Idli, Dosa, Medu Vada, Steamed Rice etc. It is known as Sambaru in Karnataka, Kuzhambu in Tamilnadu and Sambhar in North India due to different dialects but its preparation is same and it requires cooking steamed/boiled vegetables and lentils with sautéed tomato onion and spicy mix of tamarind, Sambar Masala Powder and varieties of spices.

			Bisibelabath
		</div>
		<p>
			Bisibelabath means “Hot Lentil Rice” in Kannada. Bisibelabath is a popular recipe in Karnataka. We make Sambar Rice in Tamilnadu which is much similar to Bisibelabath. The uniqueness is its spice powder which has the tinge of masala. In our Tamilnadu version of Kadamba sambar, we also use the freshly ground sambar powder which has dal, coriander seeds, fenugreek, red chili and coconut. In addition to these spices, for Bisibelabath we use dry coconut, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and fennel. These few spices really add a nice flavor and makes this sambar rice even more special.
